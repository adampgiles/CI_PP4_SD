## Project Goals
supportDev is a membership creation platform, tailored towards Developers. Developers create a Profile where they provide Supporters with access to exclusive content. This content could be; Developer Logs, Source Code, or links to products/apps. Developers set the access price for Supporters.

Supporters create an account to purchase access to Developer Profiles, as a way of supporting the Developer.
